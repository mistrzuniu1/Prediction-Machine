Prediction Machine is my first machine learning project, which is still in progress.

My concept of this program is to train classifier which will be able to predict full time results of football matches(1. Bundesliga). 


To see prediction for upcoming matches open [this](data/UpcomingBundesligaProbablity.csv)

In [this](run.ipynb) file, I demonstrate how to run my project.

In my project I used:
- scikit learn
- numpy
- pandas
- xgboost

I am using the dataset retrived from http://football-data.co.uk/data.php.
